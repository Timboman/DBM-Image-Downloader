# DBM-Image-Downloader
This is a short python script to download all of the pages of [Dragon Ball Multiverse](https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/) (as of 27 March 2020) to be imported into my Kindle using [Kindle Comic Converter](https://kcc.iosphe.re/) & [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

## Notes & Instructions:
<ul>
<li>This code was designed to run with Python 2.7</li>
<li>Be sure that you have proper Write Permissions for the directory you run Downloader.py in</li>
<li>When you run this script, a new directory "Dragon Ball Multiverse" will be created. All of the pages will be downloaded into this directory</li>
<li>Once the download is complete, just import the directory "Dragon Ball Multiverse" into Kindle Comic Converter</li>
<li>KCC should create 2 .mobi files (the visual novel is too large to fit into 1). These can be uploaded to your Kindle using a program such as Calibre.</li>
</ul>



#### Disclaimer
I have no association with the authors of Dragon Ball Multiverse, nor the creators of Kindle Comic Converter and Calibre. Additionally, Dragonball, DragonBall Z, DragonBall GT, and DragonBall Super are all owned by Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Akira Toriyama. I __HIGHLY__ recommend that you support the official release.

Yes, I shamelessly borrowed the 2nd half of the disclaimer from Team Four Star (of whom I also hold no affiliation). If you haven't heard of them & are a fan of all things DragonBall you'll definetely want to check out their [DBZ Abridged Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&t=1s).
