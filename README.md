# DBM-Image-Downloader
A short Python Script that I wrote to download all of the pages of Dragon Ball Multiverse (as of 27 March 2020) into a directory to be imported into Kindle Comic Converter.

## Notes:
<ul>
<li>Page 1000 is special. You can download it yourself if you want at https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/en/page-1000.html#h_read</li>
<li>When I ran this, pages 1190, 1232, & 1691 were downloaded corrupted. You can download any corrupted files manually. Just replace the page number in the link in the previous bullet & inspect the image to get the download link.</li>
</ul>
